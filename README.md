# PepsiCo-Dashboard
Project Title: PepsiCo Plant KPI Dashboard ‚Äì Manufacturing Efficiency & Sustainability Tracker

Short Description / Purpose: This Power BI dashboard is designed to visualize and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) for PepsiCo's manufacturing plant. It enables stakeholders and plant managers to track year-on-year operational performance, sustainability metrics, and resource utilization‚Äîhelping drive data-based decisions for improving efficiency and reducing wastage.

Tech Stack (with examples) üü° Tableue: Used for data modeling, DAX calculations, and creating interactive visualizations üìó Excel/CSV: Used as the source format for raw plant data exports üêô GitHub: Used for version control and project sharing Example: Used Power BI to build visuals with dynamic filters (month/year) and created DAX measures to calculate AOP vs Actual variance, technical availability, and area-wise downtime summaries.

Data Source A. Internal Plant Data exported from manufacturing systems in Excel/CSV format B. Data range includes three years: 2022, 2023, and 2024 C. Key metrics covered:

Actual vs AOP consumption (Power, HSD, LPG, Rice Husk, Water)
Area-wise downtime data (Process, Packaging, Utility)
Production Volume (in Metric Tonnes)
Technical Availability (in percentage)
Features and Highlights A. Time-based filtering
Allows monthly and yearly analysis using slicers for better performance comparison. B. AOP vs Actual performance comparison
Helps visualize variances between planned (AOP) and actual values across resources. C. Utility consumption tracking
Includes Power (kWh), HSD (liters), LPG (kg), Rice Husk (kg), and Water (kg/kg of production). D. Area-wise downtime breakdown
Clearly shows downtime contribution from Process, Packaging, and Utility departments. E. Production volume and technical availability
Displays total production output and equipment uptime for performance benchmarking. F. Visual-driven decision support -Clean design and interactive elements make the dashboard usable for engineers, team leads, and plant heads with minimal training.
Business Problem and Solution Business Problem: The plant leadership lacked a consolidated view of year-over-year performance across utilities, downtimes, and production metrics. Manual data analysis using spreadsheets was time-consuming, error-prone, and non-visual. Solution: A centralized Power BI dashboard was developed that combines historical data, calculates key metrics, and visually presents performance indicators. This enabled data-driven reviews, faster RCA, proactive resource management, and increased visibility into problem areas. Impact:
Enabled 25% faster decision-making during monthly reviews
Identified overconsumption trends early, saving operational costs
Reduced manual reporting time by over 60%
Key Questions Answered by the Dashboard
What is the month-on-month and year-on-year production trend?
How do Actual vs AOP figures compare across utilities?
Which area (Process, Packaging, Utility) is contributing the most to downtime?
What is the overall technical availability of the plant?
How is the plant performing against sustainability targets (like water and rice husk consumption)?
Are there any seasonal spikes in fuel or water usage?
Where can we take corrective actions to improve efficiency?
